we/prp propose/vbp a/dt new/jj method/nn for/in contour/nn tracking/nn in/in video/nn ./punct
the/dt inverted/jj distance/nn transform/vb of/in the/dt edge/nn map/nn is/vbz used/vbn as/in an/dt edge/nn indicator/nn function/nn for/in contour/nn detection/nn ./punct
using/vbg the/dt concept/nn of/in topographical/jj distance/nn ,/punct the/dt watershed/jj segmentation/nn can/md be/vb formulated/vbn as/in a/dt minimization/nn ./punct
this/dt new/jj viewpoint/nn gives/vbz a/dt way/nn to/to combine/vb the/dt results/nns of/in the/dt watershed/jj algorithm/nn on/in different/jj surfaces/nns ./punct

the/dt compensation/nn with/in object/nn motion/nn allows/vbz to/to detect/vb and/cc remove/vb spurious/jj edges/nns in/in background/nn ./punct
