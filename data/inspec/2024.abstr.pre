a/dt fourier-based/jj solution/nn to/to the/dt problem/nn of/in figure-ground/jj segmentation/nn in/in short/jj baseline/nn binocular/jj image/nn pairs/nns is/vbz presented/vbn ./punct
each/dt image/nn is/vbz modeled/vbn as/in an/dt additive/jj composite/nn of/in two/cd component/nn images/nns that/wdt exhibit/vbp a/dt spatial/jj shift/nn due/jj to/to the/dt binocular/jj parallax/nn ./punct
the/dt segmentation/nn is/vbz accomplished/vbn by/in decoupling/vbg each/dt fourier/nn component/nn in/in one/cd of/in the/dt resultant/jj additive/jj images/nns into/in its/prp$ two/cd constituent/jj phasors/nns ,/punct allocating/vbg each/dt to/to its/prp$ appropriate/jj object-specific/jj spectrum/nn ,/punct and/cc then/rb reconstructing/vbg the/dt foreground/nn and/cc background/nn using/vbg the/dt inverse/jj fourier/nn transform/vb ./punct
it/prp is/vbz shown/vbn that/in the/dt foreground/nn and/cc background/nn shifts/nns can/md be/vb computed/vbn from/in the/dt differences/nns of/in the/dt magnitudes/nns and/cc phases/nns of/in the/dt fourier/nn transform/vb of/in the/dt binocular/jj image/nn pair/nn ./punct
