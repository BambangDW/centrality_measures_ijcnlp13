this/dt paper/nn presents/vbz a/dt new/jj class/nn of/in interactive/jj image/nn editing/nn operations/nns designed/vbn to/to maintain/vb consistency/nn between/in multiple/jj images/nns of/in a/dt physical/jj 3d/nn scene/nn ./punct
the/dt distinguishing/vbg feature/nn of/in these/dt operations/nns is/vbz that/in edits/vbz to/to any/dt one/cd image/nn propagate/vb automatically/rb to/to all/dt other/jj images/nns as/in if/in the/dt (/punct unknown/jj )/punct 3d/nn scene/nn had/vbd itself/prp been/vbn modified/vbn ./punct
the/dt modified/vbn scene/nn can/md then/rb be/vb viewed/vbn interactively/rb from/in any/dt other/jj camera/nn viewpoint/nn and/cc under/in different/jj scene/nn illuminations/nns ./punct
the/dt approach/nn is/vbz useful/jj first/rb as/in a/dt power-assist/nn that/wdt enables/vbz a/dt user/nn to/to quickly/rb modify/vb many/jj images/nns by/in editing/nn just/rb a/dt few/jj ,/punct and/cc second/jj as/in a/dt means/nn for/in constructing/vbg and/cc editing/nn image-based/jj scene/nn representations/nns by/in manipulating/vbg a/dt set/nn of/in photographs/nns ./punct
the/dt approach/nn works/vbz by/in extending/vbg operations/nns like/in image/nn painting/nn ,/punct scissoring/nn ,/punct and/cc morphing/vbg so/rb that/in they/prp alter/vbp a/dt scene/nn 's/pos plenoptic/jj function/nn in/in a/dt physically-consistent/jj way/nn ,/punct thereby/rb affecting/vbg scene/nn appearance/nn from/in all/dt viewpoints/nns simultaneously/rb ./punct
a/dt key/jj element/nn in/in realizing/vbg these/dt operations/nns is/vbz a/dt new/jj volumetric/jj decomposition/nn technique/nn for/in reconstructing/vbg an/dt scene/nn 's/pos plenoptic/jj function/nn from/in an/dt incomplete/jj set/nn of/in camera/nn viewpoints/nns ./punct
