let/vb l/nn be/vb one/cd of/in the/dt intuitionistic/jj modal/jj logics/nns ./punct
as/in in/in the/dt classical/jj modal/jj case/nn ,/punct we/prp define/vbp two/cd different/jj forms/nns of/in the/dt beth/nnp property/nn for/in l/nn ,/punct which/wdt are/vbp denoted/vbn by/in b1/nn and/cc b2/nn ;/punct in/in this/dt paper/nn we/prp study/vbp the/dt relation/nn among/in b1/nn ,/punct b2/nn and/cc the/dt interpolation/nn properties/nns c1/nn and/cc c2/nn ./punct
it/prp turns/vbz out/rp that/in c1/nn implies/vbz b1/nn ,/punct but/cc contrary/jj to/to the/dt boolean/jj case/nn ,/punct is/vbz not/rb equivalent/jj to/to b1/nn ./punct
it/prp is/vbz shown/vbn that/in b2/nn and/cc c2/nn are/vbp independent/jj ,/punct and/cc moreover/rb it/prp comes/vbz out/rp that/in ,/punct in/in contrast/nn to/to classical/jj case/nn ,/punct there/ex exists/vbz an/dt extension/nn of/in the/dt intuitionistic/jj modal/jj logic/nn of/in s/sub/nn 4/-type/jj ,/punct that/wdt has/vbz not/rb the/dt property/nn b2/nn ./punct
finally/rb we/prp give/vbp two/cd algebraic/jj properties/nns ,/punct that/in characterize/vbp respectively/rb b1/nn and/cc b2/nn ./punct
