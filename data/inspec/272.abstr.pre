median/jj partitioning/nn :/punct a/dt novel/jj method/nn for/in the/dt selection/nn of/in representative/jj subsets/nns from/in large/jj compound/nn pools/nns ./punct
a/dt method/nn termed/vbn median/nn partitioning/vbg (/punct mp/nn )/punct has/vbz been/vbn developed/vbn to/to select/vb diverse/jj sets/nns of/in molecules/nns from/in large/jj compound/nn pools/nns ./punct
unlike/in many/jj other/jj methods/nns for/in subset/nn selection/nn ,/punct the/dt mp/nn approach/nn does/vbz not/rb depend/vb on/in pairwise/jj comparison/nn of/in molecules/nns and/cc can/md therefore/rb be/vb applied/vbn to/to very/rb large/jj compound/nn collections/nns ./punct
the/dt only/jj time/nn limiting/vbg step/nn is/vbz the/dt calculation/nn of/in molecular/jj descriptors/nns for/in database/nn compounds/nns ./punct
mp/nn employs/vbz arrays/nns of/in property/nn descriptors/nns with/in little/jj correlation/nn to/to divide/vb large/jj compound/nn pools/nns into/in partitions/nns from/in which/wdt representative/jj molecules/nns can/md be/vb selected/vbn ./punct
in/in each/dt of/in n/nn subsequent/jj steps/nns ,/punct a/dt population/nn of/in molecules/nns is/vbz divided/vbn into/in subpopulations/nns above/in and/cc below/in the/dt median/jj value/nn of/in a/dt property/nn descriptor/nn until/in a/dt desired/vbn number/nn of/in 2/sup/jj n//nn partitions/nns are/vbp obtained/vbn ./punct
for/in descriptor/nn evaluation/nn and/cc selection/nn ,/punct an/dt entropy/jj formulation/nn was/vbd embedded/vbn in/in a/dt genetic/jj algorithm/nn ./punct
mp/nn has/vbz been/vbn applied/vbn to/to generate/vb a/dt subset/nn of/in the/dt available/nnp chemicals/nnp directory/nnp ,/punct and/cc the/dt results/nns have/vbp been/vbn compared/vbn with/in cell-based/jj partitioning/nn ./punct
