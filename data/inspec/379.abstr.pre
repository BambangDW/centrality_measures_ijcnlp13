a/dt feedforward/jj maximum/nn power/nn (/punct mp/nn )/punct point/nn tracking/nn scheme/nn is/vbz developed/vbn for/in the/dt interleaved/jj dual/jj boost/nn (/punct idb/nn )/punct converter/nn fed/nn photovoltaic/jj (/punct pv/nn )/punct system/nn using/vbg fuzzy/jj controller/nn ./punct
the/dt tracking/nn algorithm/nn changes/vbz the/dt duty/nn ratio/nn of/in the/dt converter/nn such/jj that/in the/dt solar/jj cell/nn array/nn (/punct sca/nnp )/punct voltage/nn equals/vbz the/dt voltage/nn corresponding/vbg to/to the/dt mp/nn point/nn at/in that/dt solar/jj insolation/nn ./punct
this/dt is/vbz done/vbn by/in the/dt feedforward/nn loop/nn ,/punct which/wdt generates/vbz an/dt error/nn signal/nn by/in comparing/vbg the/dt instantaneous/jj array/nn voltage/nn and/cc reference/nn voltage/nn ./punct
the/dt reference/nn voltage/nn for/in the/dt feedforward/nn loop/nn ,/punct corresponding/vbg to/to the/dt mp/nn point/nn ,/punct is/vbz obtained/vbn by/in an/dt off-line/jj trained/jj neural/jj network/nn ./punct
experimental/jj data/nns is/vbz used/vbn for/in off-line/jj training/nn of/in the/dt neural/jj network/nn ,/punct which/wdt employs/vbz back-propagation/jj algorithm/nn ./punct
the/dt proposed/vbn fuzzy/jj feedforward/jj peak/nn power/nn tracking/nn effectiveness/nn is/vbz demonstrated/vbn through/in the/dt simulation/nn and/cc experimental/jj results/nns ,/punct and/cc compared/vbn with/in the/dt conventional/jj proportional/jj plus/cc integral/jj (/punct pi/nn )/punct controller/nn based/vbn system/nn ./punct
