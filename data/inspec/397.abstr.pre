this/dt paper/nn discusses/vbz an/dt efficient/jj numerical/jj approximation/nn technique/nn ,/punct called/vbd the/dt differential/jj quadrature/nn method/nn (/punct dqm/nn )/punct ,/punct which/wdt has/vbz been/vbn adapted/vbn to/to model/vb lossy/jj uniform/nn and/cc nonuniform/jj transmission/nn lines/nns ./punct
the/dt dqm/nn can/md quickly/rb compute/vb the/dt derivative/nn of/in a/dt function/nn at/in any/dt point/nn within/in its/prp$ bounded/jj domain/nn by/in estimating/vbg a/dt weighted/jj linear/jj sum/nn of/in values/nns of/in the/dt function/nn at/in a/dt small/jj set/nn of/in points/nns belonging/vbg to/to the/dt domain/nn ./punct
using/vbg the/dt dqm/nn ,/punct the/dt frequency-domain/jj telegrapher/nn 's/pos partial/jj differential/jj equations/nns for/in transmission/nn lines/nns can/md be/vb discretized/vbn into/in a/dt set/nn of/in easily/rb solvable/jj algebraic/jj equations/nns ./punct
dqm/nn reduces/vbz interconnects/nns into/in multiport/jj models/nns whose/wp$ port/nn voltages/nns and/cc currents/nns are/vbp related/vbn by/in rational/jj formulas/nns in/in the/dt frequency/nn domain/nn ./punct
although/in the/dt rationalization/nn process/nn in/in dqm/nnp is/vbz comparable/jj with/in the/dt pade/nnp approximation/nn of/in asymptotic/jj waveform/nn evaluation/nn (/punct awe/nnp )/punct applied/vbd to/to transmission/nn lines/nns ,/punct the/dt derivation/nn mechanisms/nns in/in these/dt two/cd disparate/jj methods/nns are/vbp significantly/rb different/jj ./punct
unlike/in awe/nn ,/punct which/wdt employs/vbz a/dt complex/jj moment-matching/jj process/nn to/to obtain/vb rational/jj approximation/nn ,/punct the/dt dqm/nn requires/vbz no/dt approximation/nn of/in transcendental/jj functions/nns ,/punct thereby/rb avoiding/vbg the/dt process/nn of/in moment/nn generation/nn and/cc moment/nn matching/nn ./punct
due/jj to/to global/jj sampling/nn of/in points/nns in/in the/dt dqm/nn approximation/nn ,/punct it/prp requires/vbz far/rb fewer/jjr grid/nn points/nns in/in order/nn to/to build/vb accurate/jj discrete/jj models/nns than/in other/jj numerical/jj methods/nns do/vbp ./punct
the/dt dqm-based/jj time-domain/jj model/nn can/md be/vb readily/rb integrated/vbn in/in a/dt circuit/nn simulator/nn like/in spice/nn ./punct
