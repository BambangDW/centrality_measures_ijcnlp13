a/dt novel/jj bitline/nn sensing/vbg scheme/nn is/vbz proposed/vbn for/in low-voltage/jj dram/nn to/to achieve/vb low/jj power/nn dissipation/nn and/cc compatibility/nn with/in low-voltage/jj cmos/nns ./punct
one/cd of/in the/dt major/jj obstacles/nns in/in low-voltage/jj dram/nn is/vbz the/dt degradation/nn of/in data-retention/jj time/nn due/jj to/to low/jj signal/nn level/nn at/in the/dt memory/nn cell/nn ,/punct which/wdt requires/vbz power-consuming/jj refresh/jj operations/nns more/rbr frequently/rb ./punct

it/prp also/rb improves/vbz die/vb efficiency/nn ,/punct because/in the/dt proposed/vbn scheme/nn reduces/vbz the/dt number/nn of/in sense/nn amplifiers/nns by/in supporting/vbg more/jjr cells/nns in/in each/dt sense/nn amplifier/nn ./punct
